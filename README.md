# Sopho_Proj_Airport_Manager

The Airport Manager project entailed developing a software application capable of computing and presenting the distance between two airports, subsequently deriving the associated cost based on this distance. We were provided with multiple text files containing predefined airport codes and corresponding locations, alongside initial skeleton code requiring completion. Utilizing this data, our task involved importing the airports into the program as 'airport' objects for efficient data storage.

Looking ahead, should I revisit this project, I aspire to enhance its functionality by integrating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JFrame. This GUI would serve to comprehensively display pertinent information while facilitating the incorporation of additional features. Prospective enhancements may encompass functionalities such as the ability to append or remove airports, dynamically adjust pricing structures during peak holiday seasons, and even integrate personal data capture to accrue flyer miles per flight. While these aspirations remain forward-looking, immediate implementation is not within my current timeframe.
This project served as the culminating assignment for my Java 2 course at VSU, where I undertook it independently. While initial code scaffolding was provided and marked by my esteemed professor, Dr. Gibson, I assumed responsibility for its augmentation and completion.

Though not extensive in scope, the project demanded diligence and efficiency within a constrained timeframe, spanning a mere few weeks. Despite these challenges, I am pleased to note that I achieved a flawless grade, underscoring my adeptness and commitment to delivering high-quality work under pressure.
