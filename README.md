# Sopho_Proj_Airport_Manager

The airport manager project was to make a program that can calculate and display the distance between two airports, then calculate the cost based on that distance.  We were given several text files that had known airport codes and locations along with skeleton code that needed to be completed.  With this information, we needed to import the airports into the program into an object 'airport' which would store the data.

If I ever get a chance to come back to this, I would like to add a GUI using JFrame to be able to display all the information as well as adding some more features.  Such features would likely include the ability to add or delete airports, adjust prices near known holidays, or even add person data to collect flyer miles with each flight.  That is mostly thinking in the future, I don't plan to have the time to do this anytime soon.

This project served as the culminating assignment for my Java 2 course at VSU, where I undertook it independently. While initial code scaffolding was provided and marked by my esteemed professor, Dr. Gibson, I assumed responsibility for its augmentation and completion.

Though not extensive in scope, the project demanded diligence and efficiency within a constrained timeframe, spanning a mere few weeks. Despite these challenges, I am pleased to note that I achieved a flawless grade, underscoring my adeptness and commitment to delivering high-quality work under pressure.
